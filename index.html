      <h2>Our Closest Star: Proxima Centauri</h2>
      <p>
      The star's name is Proxima, or its official name is known better today, Proxima Centauri. Proxima Centauri is derived from Latin and means "nearest star of Centaurus." Proxima Centauri was given because it is the closest star to Earth outside our solar system. The star is a small class M planet with an 11.2-day orbital period. As said in the article Scientists Say: Proxima Centauri. Proxima Centauri has a surface temperature of 3,042 Kelvin. Proxima Centauri has "...a mass of only 0.1221 solar masses (an eighth of the Sun's mass or 129 times the mass of Jupiter) and a radius of 0.1542 solar radii… (admin, 2020)," the article Star Facts says. A watcher from Earth sees that Proxima Centauri has a reddish color, indicating it is a main sequence star. With a considerably low luminosity, the star shines with a solar luminosity of only 0.0017 and only about 0.0056% of the sun. With over 85% of output energy being invisible inferred. We can see this on the graph below, with Proxima Centauri at the bottom right of the Main Sequence Star section being a star with low luminosity and surface temperature compared to other stars.

      Compared to our bright star, the Sun, Proxima Centauri has many differences. First, the star is around 400 million years older than the Sun, at ~4.6 billion years old. The luminosity is about 0.15%, that is 500 times less bright than our sun. The luminosity is because Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf, a type that is much smaller and less luminous than other stars, such as the Sun. While it is clear that the Sun and Proxima Centauri are not identical, with many more differences, it is also important to note that they share some similarities. Both stars produce intense magnetic activity, which releases high-energy particles, such as X-rays and flares. Also, the Sun and Proxima Centauri are main-sequence stars, producing helium to create energy through nuclear fusion. This brings us to the star's life cycle. As was said before, Proxima Centauri is a main sequence star, just like the Sun. Nevertheless, unlike the Sun, Proxima Centauri is around 400 million years older than the Sun, or around 5 billion years old.

      Using the Parallax method, we can determine the distance Proxima Centauri is from Earth, which is approximately 4.24 light-years away from Earth. The simplified process is trigonometry, says Space.com, and with the use of the sun and earth, we can figure out the distance from Earth. Given its proximity to Earth, Proxima Centauri has been the subject of much interest and study by astronomers. This proximity has allowed us to gather a wealth of information about the star's size, mass, age, activity, exoplanets, luminosity, and spectral type. Let us take a closer look at some of these critical characteristics. Today, the star's spectral type is classified as M5V. M5V means an excellent dwarf star with a medium amount of luminosity. Another essential detail or characteristic is its exoplanet. At least one confirmed exoplanet named Proxima Centauri b, a rocky, earth-sized exoplanet located in the star's habitable zone. This makes the exoplanet a big target for scientists in future studies and a potential location for extraterrestrial life. However, because Proxima Centauri is an excellent red dwarf star, its habitable zone would be very close to it. Proxima Centauri would likely emit solar flares and high radiation levels onto its exoplanet. Despite that, Proxima Centauri is the closest known star to our solar system and still creates much excitement for future studies.

      However, the real question still exists, how long would it take for someone on Earth to get to Proxima Centauri? Based on our current understanding of the laws of physics, nothing can reach or travel faster than the speed of light. Since as objects reach the speed of light, their mass increases infinitely. Our current fastest manufactured object, the Parker Solar Probe, can travel at 191,120 m/s. Compared to the speed of light, which travels at 299,792,458 m/s, the speed of light is about 1568 times faster than the probe. We can determine how long these speeds will take using the equation Travel Time = Distance ÷ Speed. The time it takes the probe to reach Proxima Centauri is (40,000,000,000,000 ÷  191,120 m/s = ) 210,782 years, while traveling at the speed of light only takes (40,000,000,000,000 ÷ 299,792,458 m/s = ) 4.24 years. Although the time it takes to reach Proxima Centauri would hold around 2634 using today's information about lifespan and age of having children, the result would be 2634 generations. Derived from 210,782 years divided by 80 years, if we could create teleporters that seemingly travel at the speed of light, we know it would take 4.24 years to get to the star. However, knowing today's technology is not the technological achievement we need it to be, the fastest time it would take us would be 210,782 years.

      In conclusion, Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf star located approximately 4.24 light-years from Earth. It is one of the closest stars to our Sun and has an exoplanet named Proxima Centauri b that has been confirmed to exist. Despite being much smaller and less luminous than our Sun, it still has great significance to astronomers and scientists because of its proximity to us. While it would take an immense amount of time to travel to Proxima Centauri with current technology, continued research and advancements in space travel could one day make it possible to explore this exciting and unique star system.
